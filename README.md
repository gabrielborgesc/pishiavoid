## üîß Local Development

To develop and test the PhishiAvoid extension locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed on your machine:

- Node.js (recommended version 16.x LTS)  
- npm (usually comes bundled with Node.js)  
- React (already listed as a project dependency and will be installed via npm)  

> **Tip:** We recommend using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage multiple Node.js versions on your system. To install Node.js 16, for example, run:

````bash
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
````

### Steps to run in development mode

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gabrielborgesc/pishiavoid.git
    cd pishiavoid
    ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start Webpack in watch mode to automatically compile changes:

    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```

    This will make Webpack watch for code changes and output the compiled files to the `dist` folder.

4. Open Google Chrome and go to the extensions page:

    ```
    chrome://extensions/
    ```

5. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top right corner).

6. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder inside your project.

### Important note

Whenever you make changes to the source code, Webpack will automatically recompile. To see the updates in Chrome, return to the `chrome://extensions/` page and click the **Refresh** button (refresh icon) on the loaded extension.
